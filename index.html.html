          <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
          <p>Hey, I'm sam but for throughout the course I am Morpheus. I was <strong>born and raised in Harlem</strong> and always had an interest in tech..<p>
          <p><strong>Since the class started, I've learned to love science again</strong>. I enjoy learning new methods and systems as well as technology big and small.</p>

          <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
          <p><strong>When I was still a Psychology major, I landed myself a research internship for Columbia University</strong>. I was very much intimidated throughout the application process and even more so when I started training, but I put my big boy pants on and was at the internship for about a year.</p>
          <p>After about a year of the internship, <span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">I decided to leave because I knew I no longer wanted to be in the Psych field.</span> <strong>I kind of spent the time after that playing music and trying to find myself</strong>. One thing led to another and now I'm learning to code. </p>

          <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
          <p> I grew up in a musical household so <strong>I love playing the bass</strong>. There's something about that low end that you can't beat. I never went to school for it and I can't read music, but I can defintely feel the groove.</p>
          <p> My second love is <strong>skateboarding</strong>. When I got my board a lot of my friends were skating a little bit but they all stopped. I kept skating, not because I wanted to be rich and famous, but because I loved the sport. Once I learned how to ollie, a spiritual door opened up. It was breathtaking.</p>
